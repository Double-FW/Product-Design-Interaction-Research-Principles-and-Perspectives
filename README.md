# Product Design Principles and Perspectives

Product Design Principles and Perspectives is a source repository for structuring design philosophy, customer research, synthetic perspective models, and AI-assisted research management across functional and emotional experience.

The repository deliberately holds paired accounts of sighted and nonvisual digital experience. Its purpose is not to decide which perspective is correct. Its purpose is to expose how the same service can communicate meaning, control, confidence, safety, and brand value through different perceptual and interaction routes.

This README is written primarily for an LLM or autonomous agent managing a research programme. Human researchers, designers, product teams, accessibility specialists, and brand teams can use the same operating model.

> **Central principle:** do not ask only whether a person can complete a task. Ask what the interaction requires of them, what it communicates emotionally, and whether those outcomes remain comparable across ways of perceiving and interacting.

---

## 1. Mission for an autonomous research manager

An AI system managing this repository should help a research team:

- turn the source documents into explicit research questions and hypotheses;
- separate functional performance from emotional interpretation without pretending they are unrelated;
- structure sighted and nonvisual perspectives independently before comparing them;
- plan qualitative, quantitative, accessibility, and longitudinal research;
- identify whose perspective is present, absent, assumed, or overgeneralised;
- produce source-constrained synthetic personas and perspective models for planning;
- manage research questions, protocols, evidence, findings, decisions, and follow-up;
- recommend the smallest useful next investigation rather than generating research activity for its own sake;
- preserve uncertainty and prevent simulated evidence from being mistaken for customer evidence.

The AI may act as an organiser, analyst, critic, protocol drafter, synthesis partner, and programme coordinator. It must not impersonate research participants, invent findings, or treat a synthetic persona as proof that a design works.

### Source authority

- Use the **nonvisual expectations** document for detailed nonvisual needs, priorities, preferences, and comparison rules.
- Use the paired **POUR brand outcome** documents for functional and emotional outcome framing.
- Use the paired **Dieter Rams** documents for design philosophy and trade-off questions.
- Use the **sighted principles and methods** document for research process, observation, iteration, mixed methods, and cautions about overclaiming.
- Preserve the first-person and perspective-specific nature of each source. Do not rewrite a perspective as a universal user truth.

---

## 3. Perspective boundary and terminology

The repository currently contains:

- a sighted perspective; and
- a deliberately nonvisual perspective written from a congenitally blind point of view.

The nonvisual material is relevant to research involving blind people and some people who use screen readers, Braille, keyboards, touch, voice, or other nonvisual interaction methods. It must not be presented as representing:

- every blind person;
- every screen-reader user;
- people with partial sight or low vision;
- people who rely on magnification, contrast changes, visual simplification, or residual vision;
- people whose sight changes over time; or
- the full intersection of vision, cognition, mobility, hearing, language, culture, age, fatigue, pain, and environment.

When a task asks for a “vision-impaired perspective,” the AI must state whether it is using:

1. the repository's **nonvisual congenitally blind perspective**;
2. evidence from real participants with specified vision-related needs; or
3. an acknowledged hypothesis requiring research.

Do not fill the low-vision evidence gap by blending sighted and nonvisual sources. Treat it as a missing perspective to be recruited or added to the repository.

---

## 4. Research philosophy

The repository supports five linked principles.

### 4.1 Successful outcomes come before presentation

The primary question is whether a person can receive the meaning, complete the task, make an informed choice, verify the result, preserve privacy, and recover. Presentation, novelty, and brand expression are valuable when they support those outcomes.

### 4.2 Functional and emotional outcomes form one causal chain

Functional behaviour provides the evidence from which emotion and trust emerge.

> what the service enables → how much effort and uncertainty it creates → what the person feels → what they learn to believe about the brand

A person cannot be persuaded into feeling capable while blocked from acting. Equally, technically successful completion may still damage trust when it requires excessive effort, produces uncertainty, or treats errors without dignity.

### 4.3 Different perspectives must first remain separate

Sighted experience may rely on simultaneous overview, visual hierarchy, grouping, shape, position, colour, imagery, and movement. Nonvisual experience may rely on sequence, names, roles, states, relationships, boundaries, focus movement, speech, Braille, sound, haptics, and direct navigation.

An inclusive synthesis should compare these routes to meaning and action. It should not erase their differences by inventing an average user.

### 4.4 Observation is stronger than speculation

The documents provide hypotheses, language, and analytical lenses. Actual design decisions should be informed by observation of customers attempting meaningful tasks and by appropriately designed quantitative evidence.

### 4.5 Research should be iterative and proportionate

Test early, identify important barriers, make an effective change, and test again. Use lightweight reporting for low-risk formative work and stronger traceability for regulated, accessibility, procurement, longitudinal, or accountable-AI decisions.

---

## 5. Core outcome model

Every research question should be classified across two axes: functional outcome and emotional outcome.

### Functional outcome families

| Functional outcome | Research question |
|---|---|
| Meaning | Can the person perceive or otherwise receive the information, identity, choices, and status required for the task? |
| Completion | Can the person complete the same core task from beginning to end? |
| Independence | Can the person act without another person interpreting or operating the service? |
| Informed choice | Do consequences, costs, risks, and alternatives arrive before commitment? |
| Control | Can the person initiate, pause, stop, refuse, review, reverse, and choose an interaction route? |
| Orientation | Do they know where they are, what matters, what they can do, and how parts relate? |
| Feedback | Can they tell what changed and whether an action succeeded? |
| Recovery | Can they identify and correct an error without losing work or starting again? |
| Efficiency | Is interaction cost proportionate in time, attention, memory, repetition, navigation, and input? |
| Reliability | Does the experience survive changes in device, settings, content, connection, interruption, and time? |
| Richness | Does the person receive comparable meaning, representation, narrative, and choice rather than a reduced substitute? |
| Preference | Can the person use suitable input, output, speed, detail, device, and automation settings? |

### Emotional outcome families

The paired POUR documents define five emotional outcomes:

| Emotional outcome | Functional foundation | Research interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **I feel seen** | Meaning and identity reach the person through their way of perceiving. | The person experiences themselves as part of the intended audience. |
| **I feel capable** | Necessary actions are discoverable, operable, controllable, and recoverable. | The service supports agency rather than making the person solve the interface. |
| **I feel confident** | Context, sequence, labels, consequences, errors, and results make sense. | The person can predict, decide, verify, and continue. |
| **I feel safe** | The experience is honest, dependable, private, resilient, and reversible where possible. | Trust survives ordinary change, failure, and interruption. |
| **I feel valued** | The first four outcomes are delivered consistently and with proportionate effort. | The brand demonstrates that the person's time, dignity, choices, and experience matter. |

Do not calculate a single emotional score unless the research design justifies the weighting. A high “seen” score must not conceal failure of completion or safety.

---

## 6. Paired-perspective analysis protocol

For every material design question, run three analyses in order.

### Pass A: sighted perspective

Ask how a person may use:

- simultaneous overview and scanning;
- hierarchy, scale, spacing, grouping, and position;
- colour, imagery, shape, and movement;
- visual affordance and state;
- visible comparison and progress;
- visual consistency and brand expression.

Record both the functional advantage and the emotional interpretation.

### Pass B: nonvisual perspective

Ask how a person may use:

- sequence and meaningful structure;
- names, roles, descriptions, states, and relationships;
- headings, landmarks, lists, search, filtering, and shortcuts;
- focus or point-of-attention movement;
- speech, Braille, sound, haptics, keyboard, touch, or voice input;
- explicit comparison, boundaries, progress, feedback, and recovery.

Do not describe the visual design word for word. Translate its purpose, decision value, and interaction consequence.

### Pass C: comparative synthesis

Identify:

- the shared outcome;
- the sighted route to that outcome;
- the nonvisual route to that outcome;
- information or agency present in one route but absent in the other;
- differences in effort, memory, time, privacy, and recovery;
- emotional divergence;
- evidence required from real participants;
- design opportunities that improve both routes without forcing them to be identical.

Use this structure:

```yaml
shared_outcome: "<what both perspectives need to achieve>"
sighted_route: "<how the outcome is currently perceived and achieved visually>"
nonvisual_route: "<how the outcome is currently perceived and achieved nonvisually>"
functional_difference: "<difference in completion, control, effort, or reliability>"
emotional_difference: "<difference in feeling seen, capable, confident, safe, or valued>"
exclusion_risk: "none | inconvenience | material friction | dependency | blocked outcome"
evidence_status: "source-derived hypothesis | observed | quantitatively supported | unresolved"
next_research_action: "<smallest useful investigation>"
```

## 7. Design philosophy generator

When asked to create a design philosophy, the AI should synthesize rather than copy a single source.

### Required structure

1. **Purpose:** the human outcome the design exists to support.
2. **Priority order:** how to resolve conflicts between completion, understanding, control, reliability, emotional quality, restraint, and novelty.
3. **Sighted expression:** how visual composition can support the purpose.
4. **Nonvisual expression:** how structure, language, sequence, state, and behaviour can support the same purpose.
5. **Functional commitments:** observable capabilities the design must provide.
6. **Emotional commitments:** what repeated interaction should teach a person about their agency and relationship with the brand.
7. **Trade-off rules:** what must win when principles conflict.
8. **Research questions:** what cannot be settled by philosophy alone.
9. **Evidence plan:** how the commitments will be tested with customers.
10. **Revision rule:** what evidence should cause the philosophy to change.

### Philosophy questions derived from the paired Rams documents

- Does innovation remove a real barrier or merely introduce novelty?
- Can the intended outcome be completed independently?
- Does aesthetic quality strengthen understanding in both visual and nonvisual forms?
- Does the product explain itself through appearance, language, structure, and behaviour?
- Is the interface proportionate to the task, or does it compete for attention?
- Does the service tell the truth about action, consequence, data, automation, uncertainty, and refusal?
- Does change preserve useful learned behaviour?
- Are loading, empty, failure, interruption, and recovery states designed with equal care?
- Does the service conserve device, data, energy, and human attention while preserving access?
- Has “less” removed noise, or has it removed meaning and control?

---

## 8. Research programme architecture

An AI-assisted research programme should maintain the following connected records.

| Record | Minimum content |
|---|---|
| Programme charter | Purpose, decisions supported, products or journeys, stakeholders, ethical boundaries, time horizon, and success criteria. |
| Evidence map | Existing qualitative, quantitative, behavioural, accessibility, customer-support, and operational evidence with provenance and limitations. |
| Perspective register | Perspectives included, source documents, participant evidence, missing perspectives, and generalisation limits. |
| Research question | Decision, functional outcome, emotional outcome, perspective, population, context, and uncertainty. |
| Hypothesis | Expected behaviour or outcome, reason, disconfirming evidence, and confidence. |
| Study protocol | Method, participants, recruitment, tasks, measures, access needs, facilitation, data handling, and stopping rules. |
| Observation | What happened, context, participant language, researcher interpretation, and confidence kept separate. |
| Finding | Pattern supported by evidence, scope, severity, frequency evidence, and alternative explanations. |
| Recommendation | Proposed response, expected outcome, trade-offs, owner, and validation method. |
| Decision | Action taken, evidence used, accountable owner, date, and residual uncertainty. |
| Follow-up | Change implemented, retest or measurement plan, result, and further questions. |

Every finding must trace back to evidence. Every recommendation must identify which outcome it intends to improve. Every decision must preserve what remains unknown.

---

## 9. Mixed-method research cycle

Use the following cycle rather than treating qualitative and quantitative research as interchangeable.

### Stage 1: Establish the decision

Define what decision the research will inform. Avoid broad questions such as “Do users like this?” Prefer questions such as “Can customers understand the recurring charge before confirming, and do sighted and nonvisual routes create comparable confidence?”

### Stage 2: Review existing evidence

Use customer feedback, support contacts, product analytics, accessibility findings, satisfaction data, prior studies, and repository perspectives. Separate customer evidence from source-derived hypotheses.

### Stage 3: Use quantitative evidence to locate patterns

Where valid data exists, identify journeys or customer segments with lower completion, satisfaction, confidence, or higher abandonment and support demand. Segment by functional needs and interaction preferences where ethically collected and statistically supportable.

Do not infer disability from behaviour or assistive-technology detection. Do not treat small subgroup differences as meaningful without checking sample size, uncertainty, and multiple comparisons.

### Stage 4: Use qualitative research to understand why

Recruit people relevant to the question. Give them realistic goals without naming the intended route. Observe what they notice, interpret, attempt, expect, and experience emotionally. Offer alternatives to continuous think-aloud. Test the product, not the person.

### Stage 5: Synthesize functional and emotional evidence

For each task, record completion, independence, errors, recovery, effort, and route. Then record confidence, frustration, surprise, relief, trust, dignity, and the five POUR emotional outcomes. Keep observed behaviour, participant report, and researcher inference separate.

### Stage 6: Prioritise

Consider blocked outcomes, consequence, privacy, dependency, task criticality, reach, recurrence, effort, confidence in the evidence, and whether the cause is local or systemic. Frequency is not severity: one observed barrier may represent complete exclusion.

### Stage 7: Change and evaluate

Prefer the smallest effective change when the cause is local. Address the design system, information architecture, governance, or service model when repeated local defects reveal a systemic cause.

### Stage 8: Repeat proportionately

Run formative studies early and often. Use controlled experiments, multivariate testing, or statistically powered surveys only when they fit the decision, traffic, risk, and ethical context. The source documents encourage frequent MVT and monthly cycles; the AI must treat that as a possible operating cadence, not a universal rule. An underpowered or ethically inappropriate experiment creates activity, not evidence.

---

## 10. Method selection

| Research need | Primary method | Important limit |
|---|---|---|
| Discover expectations, language, and mental models | Interviews, contextual inquiry, diary work | Self-report does not always predict behaviour. |
| Understand task barriers and recovery | Moderated or unmoderated usability evaluation | Small samples reveal problems, not prevalence. |
| Compare sighted and nonvisual routes | Paired task protocol with relevant participants | Do not use sighted screen-reader simulation as a substitute for experienced users. |
| Evaluate brand emotion | Task-based interviews plus outcome ratings | Warm language can mask functional failure; behaviour remains primary evidence. |
| Estimate prevalence or compare segments | Statistically designed survey or behavioural analysis | Requires adequate sample, accessible instruments, and careful segmentation. |
| Compare design variants | A/B or multivariate experiment | Requires power, ethical review, guardrails, and a meaningful outcome metric. |
| Evaluate an early concept | Prototype evaluation matched to the question | A visual prototype cannot answer nonvisual interaction questions. |
| Check accessibility implementation | Expert and assistive-technology evaluation | Technical testing does not establish customer usability. |
| Monitor change over time | Repeated measures, trend analysis, and recurring qualitative checks | Instrument and population changes can create false trends. |

The AI should recommend the least burdensome method capable of answering the decision question. It must explain what the chosen method cannot establish.

---

## 11. Functional and emotional measurement model

### Functional measures

- task completion and partial completion;
- independent completion;
- critical and recoverable errors;
- time and interaction steps, interpreted in context;
- navigation or listening cost;
- memory and comparison demand;
- successful recovery;
- preservation of entered work and position;
- understanding of consequences before action;
- ability to verify the result;
- abandonment and support dependence;
- route chosen and input or output method used.

### Emotional measures

Ask participants to rate and explain, where appropriate:

- I felt seen.
- I felt capable.
- I felt confident.
- I felt safe.
- I felt valued.

Add task-specific measures such as trust, control, clarity, dignity, effort, frustration, relief, and willingness to return. Use accessible response formats and allow an optional open-text or spoken response.

### Interpretation rules

- A functional failure takes precedence over positive presentation scores.
- Emotional ratings need behavioural and narrative context.
- Time alone is not a universal usability measure; expert strategies, speech rate, task complexity, and chosen input method matter.
- Do not compare sighted and nonvisual completion time as though equal speed were the only definition of equivalence. Compare outcome, effort, control, and avoidable interaction cost.
- Do not treat average satisfaction as proof that a minority was not excluded.
- Report subgroup uncertainty and do not publish identifiable small-cell data.

---

## 12. Synthetic personas and perspective models

Synthetic personas may be used to structure hypotheses, challenge assumptions, prepare research, and explore design implications. They are not research participants and do not produce customer evidence.

### Permitted uses

- identify likely differences between sighted and nonvisual routes;
- generate research questions and edge cases;
- test whether a protocol includes functional and emotional outcomes;
- rehearse interview questions or facilitation responses;
- review a journey for missing context, state, feedback, or recovery;
- expose assumptions requiring recruitment or measurement;
- create traceable perspective summaries for design workshops.

### Prohibited uses

- invent quotations, preferences, demographics, prevalence, or lived experience;
- claim that a synthetic participant completed a task;
- replace research with blind, partially sighted, or sighted customers;
- validate a design, calculate a success rate, or establish legal conformity;
- infer that all blind or vision-impaired people behave like the source perspective;
- blend conflicting perspectives into a single fictional “accessible user”;
- make high-impact product, policy, or release decisions without human evidence and accountable review.

### Required persona schema

```yaml
persona_type: "synthetic perspective model"
name: "<functional label, not a claim of a real identity>"
perspective: "sighted | nonvisual congenitally blind | other evidence-backed perspective"
source_documents: []
evidence_status: "source-derived hypothesis"
goals: []
functional_outcomes: []
emotional_outcomes: []
interaction_methods: []
context: "<task, device, environment, and familiarity>"
expected_strategies: []
possible_barriers: []
trade_off_preferences: []
assumptions: []
missing_evidence: []
questions_for_real_participants: []
confidence: "low | medium | high within the source boundary"
not_valid_for:
  - prevalence
  - validation
  - statistical comparison
  - representation of an entire population
```

Use several narrow models rather than one overloaded persona. Change context, familiarity, device, task, and interaction method explicitly; do not hide those variables inside personality traits.

---

## 13. AI autonomy and human authority

### The AI may act autonomously to

- index and retrieve source material;
- draft research questions, hypotheses, protocols, screeners, task scenarios, surveys, and discussion guides;
- generate paired sighted and nonvisual analyses;
- create synthetic perspective models with the required warnings;
- identify evidence gaps, conflicts, assumptions, and missing perspectives;
- structure de-identified observations and code qualitative data using an approved scheme;
- calculate descriptive statistics and flag when inferential analysis is unsupported;
- draft synthesis, prioritisation, research backlogs, and follow-up plans;
- recommend a method, sample rationale, accessibility requirement, or next research question;
- monitor programme status, dependencies, cadence, and unresolved decisions;
- prepare a proposed experiment or multivariate test for approval.

### Human approval is required to

- recruit or contact participants;
- decide incentives, eligibility, or exclusion criteria;
- process special-category or identifiable participant data;
- infer disability, diagnosis, or protected characteristics;
- deploy surveys, studies, prototypes, or experiments to customers;
- randomise customers into variants or alter a live service;
- make consequential product, policy, procurement, or release decisions;
- publish claims about populations, inclusion, accessibility, or brand performance;
- treat a synthetic perspective as representative evidence;
- resolve an ethical conflict or accept material residual risk.

### AI conduct rules

- Never diagnose a participant.
- Never fabricate an observation or quote.
- Never hide uncertainty behind confident prose.
- Never treat accessibility needs as personality traits.
- Never assume that a participant's difficulty proves a specific impairment.
- Minimise data and use de-identified records wherever possible.
- Separate participant words, observed behaviour, researcher interpretation, and AI inference.
- Explain the basis of every recommendation and identify what evidence could disprove it.

---

## 14. Research task and facilitation standard

### Task-writing rules

A research task should:

- describe a credible goal, not the intended control or route;
- avoid using the interface's exact labels where that would reveal the answer;
- be safe and avoid unnecessary disclosure of real personal information;
- contain enough context to make the decision meaningful;
- work for sighted and nonvisual participation, or declare why separate prototypes are required;
- permit refusal, stopping, and clarification;
- identify the functional and emotional outcomes under investigation.

### Facilitation rules

The facilitator may ask:

- What do you think this is?
- What matters to you here?
- What do you expect to happen?
- What are you trying to do next?
- What changed?
- How confident are you in the result?
- What, if anything, made you feel more or less in control?

The facilitator must not teach the interface, defend the design, signal approval, or treat the participant as if they are being tested. Continuous think-aloud is optional, not compulsory. Offer pauses, retrospective explanation, typed responses, or other suitable methods.

For nonvisual sessions, record the interaction method, navigation strategy, speech or Braille preferences where volunteered, focus movement, announcements, sequence, direct navigation, and recovery. Do not judge expertise by whether the participant uses the route expected by a sighted observer.

---

## 15. Evidence, analysis, and claim discipline

### Evidence levels

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Source-derived hypothesis | A proposition grounded in repository documents but not yet tested in the target context. |
| Single observation | Something seen or reported in one session; useful but not a population claim. |
| Qualitative pattern | A recurring or strongly consequential finding supported by several relevant observations. |
| Quantitative association | A measured difference or relationship with stated sample, uncertainty, and analysis. |
| Causal evidence | A change attributable to an intervention under an appropriate experimental or quasi-experimental design. |
| Operational signal | Feedback, support, analytics, or incident data that suggests a problem but may have unknown selection effects. |

### Claim rules

- Qualitative research explains possibilities, mechanisms, needs, and design implications; it does not estimate prevalence by itself.
- Small studies can reveal severe exclusion even when they cannot estimate how often it occurs.
- Quantitative research evaluates scale and difference only when sampling, instrumentation, and analysis support the claim.
- A/B or multivariate testing can optimise the measured outcome while degrading an unmeasured group or outcome. Always define guardrails.
- Absence of complaints is not evidence of absence; excluded people may abandon without reporting.
- Synthetic personas can support hypotheses only.
- Accessibility, usability, emotional experience, and brand experience are related but not interchangeable claims.

---

## 16. Programme decision rules

Prioritise research or action using:

1. blocked or compromised core outcomes;
2. loss of independence or privacy;
3. inability to make an informed decision;
4. irreversible or high-consequence action;
5. inability to verify, recover, or preserve work;
6. excessive recurring interaction cost;
7. emotional consequences for confidence, trust, dignity, and belonging;
8. reach and recurrence;
9. evidence confidence;
10. whether the cause is local or systemic.

Do not downgrade a finding merely because it occurred once in a small study. Do not generalise it merely because it is severe. Record severity and prevalence evidence separately.

When trade-offs are necessary, favour:

- completion over presentation;
- independence over assisted workarounds;
- meaning over visual fidelity;
- informed choice over conversion;
- control over automation;
- context before choice;
- stable structure over novelty;
- direct access over forced sequence;
- recovery over blame;
- reliable evidence over confident speculation.

## 17. LLM bootstrap and retrieval instructions

At the start of a research-management task:

1. Read this README completely.
2. Identify the decision, product or journey, customer population, context, and evidence already available.
3. Determine whether the task concerns philosophy, research planning, perspective comparison, synthetic personas, programme management, analysis, or reporting.
4. Retrieve the smallest relevant source set from section 2.
5. Keep sighted and nonvisual notes in separate evidence fields until comparative synthesis.
6. Classify every assertion by evidence level from section 15.
7. Identify missing perspectives before making recommendations.
8. Select functional and emotional outcomes explicitly.
9. Recommend a method and state what it cannot establish.
10. Identify which actions the AI may take and which require human approval.

### Retrieval routing

| Request | Retrieve first |
|---|---|
| Create a design philosophy | Both Dieter Rams perspective documents, then both POUR documents |
| Define emotional research outcomes | Both POUR documents |
| Define nonvisual tasks or needs | Nonvisual expectations document |
| Create a customer research approach | Sighted principles and methods document, then the paired perspective sources |
| Compare sighted and nonvisual experience | Matching POUR pair or Rams pair, plus relevant nonvisual expectations sections |
| Create a synthetic persona | Relevant perspective source, this README section 12, and any real contextual evidence supplied |
| Manage a research programme | This README sections 8–17 and the sighted principles and methods document |
| Prioritise findings | This README sections 11, 15, and 16, plus source sections relevant to the barrier |

## 19. Repository health and maintenance

The repository is healthy when:

- each source retains its declared first-person perspective;
- sighted and nonvisual paired files remain distinguishable and comparable;
- functional and emotional outcomes are both represented;
- synthetic material is labelled and never stored as participant evidence;
- claims are traceable to source documents or real research evidence;
- missing low-vision and other perspectives remain visible rather than being inferred;
- research methods match the questions they are intended to answer;
- autonomous actions and approval boundaries are respected;
- participant data is not stored in this philosophy repository unless a separate approved governance model explicitly permits it;
- changes to source documents trigger review of this README's mappings and generated perspective models.

### Change rules

The AI may repair broken links, improve retrieval metadata, add unambiguous indexes, or clarify an existing boundary without changing source meaning. Human review is required before changing a first-person claim, merging perspectives, altering the emotional outcome model, introducing a new population claim, or expanding the AI's authority over participants or live experiments.

### Final test

The repository is not successful because an AI can generate a convincing persona or polished research plan. It is successful when the AI helps people ask better questions, recruit the perspectives that are missing, distinguish evidence from assumption, and make design decisions that improve both functional outcomes and the emotional experience of being a customer.
